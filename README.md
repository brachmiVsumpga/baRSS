# baRSS â€“ *Menu Bar RSS Reader*

![screenshot](doc/screenshot.png)

For nearly a decade I've been using the then free version of [RSS Menu](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/rss-menu/id423069534). However, with the release of macOS Mojave, 32bit applications are no longer supported.

*baRSS* is an open source community project and will be available on the AppStore soon (hopefully); free of charge. Everything is built from the ground up with a minimal footprint in mind.


Why is this project not written in Swift?
-----------------------------------------

Actually, I started this project with Swift. Even without adding much functionality, the app was exceeding the 10 Mb file size. Compared to the nearly finished Alpha version with 500 Kb written in Objective-C. The reason for that, Swift frameworks are always packed into the final application. I decided that this level of encapsulation is a waste of space for such a small application.


3rd Party Libraries
-------------------

This project uses a modified version of Brent Simmons [RSXML](https://github.com/brentsimmons/RSXML) for feed parsing. RSXML is licensed under a MIT license (same as this project).


Current project state
---------------------

The basic functionality is there. Manually added feeds will be downloaded and stored in an SQLite database. The complete management of feeds is there (sorting, grouping, editing, deleting). The bar menu is functional too, including unread count, URL opening and display.
